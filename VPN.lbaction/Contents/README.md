#VPN
Connect, or disconnect to VPN installed in Viscosity, and Tunnelblick. This action will automatically check for the running and use it's installed configurations. If both apps are running (which is not recommend), it will give precedence to Viscocity. For Tunnelblick disconnected state is EXITING, so do not worry if it says as the status of VPN.

Just run action with Space (⎵) or Enter (↩) , it should list installed VPNs. You can navigate and select, or type few letters of name. Enter to dis/connect.
